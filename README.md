# WordGuessGame

What the project does:
  This is my 1st pass at a JavaScript! It's BEEFY! I'm a very visual person and it was difficult to piece together but eventually it worked!
  It's a first pass attempt at the word guess game "Hangman" that is a refinement canvas for my coding skills! Guess the famous movies that start with "A" to try the program out. 
  
  
Why the project is useful:
  It was definitely more useful for me than it will be for you....I learned a lot and I need to get better.
